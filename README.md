# Numismous (The Hobby of Kings)
 * Shiny app running on https://lootpiz.shinyapps.io/numismous/

### About
 * Numismatics is the study of currency and/or paper money.
 * I coined the term *Numismous* to refer this unique Web and added suffix *-ous* to the Greek word *nomismat-* (stem of *n√≥misma*).
 
### Features
 * Provides a collection of the banknotes I have so far collected.
 * Displays geographical locations of the origin of the banknotes.
 * Includes circulated and uncirculated banknotes (i.e., Disney Banknote) that are popular among collectors.
